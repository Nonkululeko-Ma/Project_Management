#  Project Management App â€“ Roadmap

A list of what has been completed, what's still in progress, and ideas for the future.

---

## Completed

- Basic user creation using the Factory Pattern
- Task assignment system
- Task status updates
- Singleton configuration class
- Simple in-memory repository layer
- Unit tests for user repository
- CI/CD setup using GitHub Actions

---

##  Incomplete

- REST API (Spring Boot): API controller was started but not successfully tested due to Spring setup issues.
- `ProjectController.java` has imports for Spring annotations, but build failed due to missing dependencies.

---

##  Future Wishlist (Ideas for Later)

-  Retry Spring Boot setup (using Maven or Gradle).
-  Add login/authentication system (OAuth or simple login).
-  Email notifications for overdue tasks.
-  Admin dashboard for project insights.
-  Export task reports to PDF/Excel.
-  Deploy to a free service (like Render, Railway, or GitHub Pages for front-end).
-  Search/filter for tasks and users.

## ASSIGNMENT 7 ## 
| Column        | Purpose                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| To Do       | Tasks that need to be started              |
| In Progress | Tasks currently being worked on            |
| Testing     | Tasks undergoing QA/testing                |
| Blocked     | Tasks waiting for external dependencies    |
| Done        | Completed tasks                            |



| Feature            | GitHub Projects     | Trello             | Jira              |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Best Use Case  | Software Development | General Task Management | Enterprise Agile Teams |
| Automation      | Yes (Kanban workflows) | No (Manual updates) | Yes (Advanced automation) |
| Issue Tracking | Yes (Linked to code) | No | Yes (Detailed issue tracking) |
| Complexity     | Moderate | Simple | Complex |


GitHub Projects is a great option for development teams because it integrates directly with repositories. While Trello is more user-friendly, it lacks automation. Jira is the most powerful but can be overwhelming for small teams.



### ASSIGNMENT 9 ## 

# Project Management System - Assignment 9 Deliverables
- I used 7 main classes based on the domain model from Task 1.
- The relationships show real-world connections like:
  - One User can create many Projects.
  - Each Project contains many Tasks.
  - Each Task can have Issues or Comments.
  - Issues can have multiple Comments.
  - Reports are generated from Projects.
  - Notifications are sent to Users.
  - I included Multiplicity (1, 0..*, 0..1) to show how many objects can exist in the relationship.
  - Attributes are private (-), methods are public (+) following UML standards.

|------------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Best Use Case  | Software Development | General Task Management | Enterprise Agile Teams |
| Automation      | Yes (Kanban workflows) | No (Manual updates) | Yes (Advanced automation) |
| Issue Tracking | Yes (Linked to code) | No | Yes (Detailed issue tracking) |
| Complexity     | Moderate | Simple | Complex |


GitHub Projects is a great option for development teams because it integrates directly with repositories. While Trello is more user-friendly, it lacks automation. Jira is the most powerful but can be overwhelming for small teams.

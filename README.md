# TaskFlow: Project Management System  

# Project Description   

TaskFlow is a web-based Project Management System designed to help teams and organizations plan, track, and execute projects efficiently.  This system is built based on thorough stakeholder analysis and a well-defined set of functional and non-functional requirements.

The system allows users to  
‚úî Create projects  
‚úî Assign tasks  
‚úî Set deadlines  
‚úî Monitor progress  
‚úî Collaborate with team members  



#  Features  
- Project Creation & Management  
- Task Assignment & Tracking 
- Deadline Notifications  
- Project Reports & Analytics  
- Team Collaboration & Messaging

## ASSIGNMENT 7 ## 
| Column        | Purpose                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| To Do       | Tasks that need to be started              |
| In Progress | Tasks currently being worked on            |
| Testing     | Tasks undergoing QA/testing                |
| Blocked     | Tasks waiting for external dependencies    |
| Done        | Completed tasks                            |



| Feature            | GitHub Projects     | Trello             | Jira              |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Best Use Case  | Software Development | General Task Management | Enterprise Agile Teams |
| Automation      | Yes (Kanban workflows) | No (Manual updates) | Yes (Advanced automation) |
| Issue Tracking | Yes (Linked to code) | No | Yes (Detailed issue tracking) |
| Complexity     | Moderate | Simple | Complex |


GitHub Projects is a great option for development teams because it integrates directly with repositories. While Trello is more user-friendly, it lacks automation. Jira is the most powerful but can be overwhelming for small teams.



### ASSIGNMENT 9 ## 

# Project Management System - Assignment 9 Deliverables
- I used 7 main classes based on the domain model from Task 1.
- The relationships show real-world connections like:
  - One User can create many Projects.
  - Each Project contains many Tasks.
  - Each Task can have Issues or Comments.
  - Issues can have multiple Comments.
  - Reports are generated from Projects.
  - Notifications are sent to Users.
  - I included Multiplicity (1, 0..*, 0..1) to show how many objects can exist in the relationship.
  - Attributes are private (-), methods are public (+) following UML standards.

## OUTPUT ##

 Implemented Simple Factory for User creation.
- Implemented Factory Method for Report generation.
- Implemented Abstract Factory for Notification types.
- Implemented Builder pattern for Project entity.
- Implemented Prototype pattern for Task cloning.
- Implemented Singleton pattern for Configuration management.


## ASSIGNMENT 11 ## 

#  Repository Layer - ProjectManagement

## Overview
This layer handles persistence operations for domain entities using a clean Repository Pattern approach.  
Initially, an in-memory storage (HashMap) is implemented for fast testing. Future storage (like a database) is also prepared.

## Components

##  Repository Layer 

| Component | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Repository.java | Generic CRUD operations using Generics |
| UserRepository.java | Specialised interface for User persistence |
| InMemoryUserRepository.java | In-memory HashMap implementation |
| DatabaseUserRepository.java | Stub for future database support |
| RepositoryFactory.java | Factory to switch between MEMORY and DATABASE repositories |
---
## Storage Abstraction
- Factory Pattern is used via "RepositoryFactory".
- Allows easy switching from memory to database in the future.

## Future-Proofing
- "DatabaseUserRepository" stub included.
- New storage systems (e.g., JSON, REST API) can easily be added.

##  How to Run Tests Locally

To run all tests locally using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean test

---

###  2. Create a PR & Screenshot

Next steps:

1. **Push a failing test** on a new branch (e.g., `feature/test-break`).
2. Open a **Pull Request** to merge into `main`.
3. Let the workflow fail.
4. Take a **screenshot** showing:
   -  "Tests failed"
   -  ‚ÄúMerging is blocked‚Äù
   - Message: "At least 1 required check failed"
